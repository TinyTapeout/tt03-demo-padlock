# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    347417602591556180        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 3.0

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Tiny Tapeout 03 (J. Rosenthal)"      # Your name
  title:        "Customizable Padlock"      # Project title
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "This design implements a customizable padlock. Set a code for your digital safe!"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Switch 2 is used to reset the safe. Switch 8 is used to set your code (on = set, off = locked). 
      Switches 3 to 5 are used to set the code. The push button is used to enter your code.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Set your desired code using Switches 3 to 5. Once you’ve done so, toggle Switch 8 to on then back off–the safe is now set!
      Turn on Switch 2, and press the push button. The seven segment display should show “L” (for locked).
      Next turn off Switch 2 to begin entering codes. If you enter a correct code, thw seven segment display should show “U” (for unlocked).
